#' Create species responses
#'
#' This function defines for each species its phenology, typical abundance, detectablity  and temporal trend.
#'
#' @param site_years A data.frame, generated by define_sites_years()
#' @param pheno_peak_mean Numeric, mean of the species phenology peak (in days from 1-365)
#' @param pheno_peak_sd Numeric, sd of the species phenology peak
#' @param pheno_range_mean Numeric, mean of the species phenology ranges
#' @param pheno_range_sd Numeric, sd of the species phenology ranges
#' @param trend_max Numeric, minimum slope of linear decline per year. Take values between 0 and infinite, with values < 1 implying declines.
#' @param trend_min Numeric, mÃ¡ximum slope of linear decline per year. Take values between 0 and infinite, with values < 1 implying declines.

#' @return A data.frame.

  #Define species abundances following a lognormal distribution
  h <- ceiling(rlnorm(n_sp, meanlog = 3)) # max abundances per species ->
  #max(h) #this gives up to ~400 individuals per site of the dominant speices
  #can use this if needed: https://rdrr.io/cran/mobsim/man/sim_sad.html

  #JRC asks about the possibility of an abundance-dependent assignation of phenological tolerances.

  #We can define also here the responses expected (i.e. trend).
  #We assume a multiplicative slope (-1 and 1) affecting the population per year.
  slope <- runif(n_sp, min = trend_min, max = trend_max)
  #We assume an uniform spread of responses across species within the specifies range.

  #Finally, we define species detectabilities
  #Assign to each species a detectability
  detect <- runif(n_sp) #random. Note that when implemented, they will be weighted by species abundance.
  detect_pan <- runif(n_sp, min = 0, max = 0.25) #Now uncorrelated with above! I set max to 0.25, as this is prob of falling in a pantrap per indiv.
