#' Create species responses
#'
#' This function defines for each species its phenology, typical abundance, detectablity  and temporal trend.
#'
#' @param site_years A data.frame, generated by define_sites_years()
#' @param pheno_peak_mean Numeric, mean of the species phenology peak (in days from 1-365)
#' @param pheno_peak_sd Numeric, sd of the species phenology peak
#' @param pheno_range_mean Numeric, mean of the species phenology ranges
#' @param pheno_range_sd Numeric, sd of the species phenology ranges
#' @param trend_max Numeric, maximum species change with time. The slope of a linear trend. Values ~ -0.25 reprsent a 1% decline per year.
#' @param trend_min Numeric, minimum species change with time. The slope of a linear trend. Values ~ -0.25 reprsent a 1% decline per year.

  ming <- 1 # gradient minimum...

  #Define phenological peaks and variances
  opt <- rnorm(n_sp, mean = pheno_peak_mean, sd = pheno_peak_sd) # It's a fair assumption? Or is bimodal spring-summer?
  tol <- rnorm(n_sp, mean = pheno_range_mean, sd = pheno_range_sd) # species tolerances (phenology ranges)

  #Define species abundances following a lognormal distribution
  h <- ceiling(rlnorm(n_sp, meanlog = 3)) # max abundances per species ->
  #max(h) #this gives up to ~400 individuals per site of the dominant speices
  #can use this if needed: https://rdrr.io/cran/mobsim/man/sim_sad.html

  #We can define also here the responses expected (i.e. trend).
  #We assume linearity with time where response = h + slope*year
  slope <- runif(n_sp, min = trend_min, max = trend_max)
  #Revisit this with a better slope rationale (now random)
  #Values ~ -0.25 represent a 1% decline per year.

  #Finally, we define species detectabilities
  #Assign to each species a detectability
  detect <- runif(n_sp) #random for now, they can depend on abundance (a function of h)?
  detect_pan <- runif(n_sp, min = 0, max = 0.25) #Now uncorrelated! I set max to 0.25, as this is prob of falling in a pantrap per indiv.
  #Think about this.
